##Design a Persistent HTTP 1.1 server based on RFC 7231 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231).


It should contain the following minimal content:
1. It should be able to handle methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE
2. It should generate a minimum of 10 response codes.
3. It should use cookies on the server and client side.
4. Can use log levels for error handling (Optional)


You can use any language for the implementation (Javascript, PHP, Python, etc.).

For verification of request messages you can use POSTMAN.

Use the following tutorial for the sample implementations: https://www.w3schools.com
